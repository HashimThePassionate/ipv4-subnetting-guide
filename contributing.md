## Style Guidelines

### HTML Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Add comments for complex sections
- Ensure all images have alt text

```html
<!-- Good Example -->
<section id="example" class="content-section">
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Clear, concise content...</p>
</section>
```

### CSS Guidelines

- Use CSS variables for colors and spacing
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Add comments for complex styles
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Support dark mode

```css
/* Good Example */
.custom-element {
    background-color: var(--accent-color);
    padding: var(--spacing-md);
    border-radius: 8px;
}
```

### JavaScript Guidelines

- Use ES6+ features
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Maintain existing code structure
- Write self-documenting code

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate subnet information based on host requirements
 * @param {number} hostsNeeded - Number of hosts required
 * @returns {Object} Subnet calculation results
 */
function calculateSubnet(hostsNeeded) {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Examples:**

```
